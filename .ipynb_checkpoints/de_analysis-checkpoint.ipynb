Each column representing a derivative with respect to xse 1,2,3,4,5 and eta 1,2,3 and then each column has a list that I get from the intlist function I made. And then maybe one of the columns are the coefficients, stored as a list of strings, since we have the greek constants α and η? Maybe one extra column to show if there are any of the constants being multiplied into the coefficients? Not quite sure what to do after that.\n",
